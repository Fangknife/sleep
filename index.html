<p>Pictured below are 134 out of the 147 days between Aug 30th, 2021, 
and Jan 24th, 2022.

<br>Each row contains 24 boxes, each box represents 1 hour.
<br>A black box represents an hour I was asleep, a white box an hour I was awake. 
<br>Some days I recorded half-hour intervals too.
<br>15 days are missing from the chart. 
<br>These were days, usually in clusters, where I was asleep to often to record.
<br>I update the document usually within a day of waking up.

    <p style="background-color:white; color: black; width: 600px">
According to doctors, psychologists, and statistics on the internet, I ideally would sleep 8 hours a day, at the same time, maybe falling asleep around 11pm or so.
<br>That is pictured below.

On an average day, this is when I will be asleep:

<br>The digit and value representing the number of days I was asleep during an hour from the latter 100 rows, per hour:
    <br><img src="recent_100_layers_counting.jpg"  width="500" height="21">
<br>The mean is 7.924999 repeating.
<br>Equivalent to 7 hours, 55 minutes, and 30 seconds of sleep per day.

<br>It is not tinnitus.

It's a fair analogy for what the sleep disorder sounds like.
<br>I thought it was a little on-the-nose.
<br>
<br>The disorder is called "Non-24-hour sleepâ€“wake disorder".
<br>Also called Free-running sleep disorder.

<br>Without artificial partitions into 24 hour periods, the sound of an alarm clock is too rythmic to be representational.

<br>This is the noise made when read as a Variable Density audio track, like that on a running film strip:

Fun trivia: N-24 occurs among 50-70% of those who are completley blind.
<br>Diagnosable causes among those who are sighted are traumatic brain injury.
<br>Otherwise, the cause is attibuted to any co-occuring psychlogical disorder in the patient.
<br>This is medical speak for 'unknown'.

I have no memory of sustaining a traumatic brain injury at any point in life.
<br>It is a bit unsettling to have the natural equivalent.
